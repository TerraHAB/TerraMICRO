<p>TerraMICRO was conceived as a payload-agnostic high altitude balloon
architecture. In addition, TerraMICRO should host one or more technical
or scientific experiments. These experiments need not be related to
uHAB---they serve as a means to validate the design and architecture
while stressing the system in a real-world use case.</p>
<h2 id="hab-architecture">μHAB Architecture</h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>μHAB is under active development. Visit the project's GitHub page for
<a href="https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/uHAB">µHAB designs and documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The purpose of μHAB is to provide a flexible, expandable, and affordable
platform that contains all of the necessary functionality for a
high-altitude balloon mission without the hassle of starting a
completely new design from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible</strong>: μHAB contains a wealth of available I/O that is broken out
to easily accessible headers. Both 5V and 3.3V digital pins are
available for ease of future component integrations. The powerful
300MHz, 32-bit microcontroller has capabilities for CANbus, EBI/EMI,
Ethernet, I²C, IrDA, LINbus, MMC/SD/SDIO, QSPI, SPI, SSC, UART/USART,
USB, x24 16-bit ADC (with oversampling), and x2 12-bit DAC. μHAB also
features selection headers for multiple types of antennas and
remove-before-flight safes.</p>
<p><strong>Expandable</strong>: The layout of the PCB includes the familiar pinout of
the common Arduino Mega so that commercial Arduino shields may be
utilized. Additional I/O is available separately. The microcontroller
selected offers enough processing power to handle many more additional
tasks and the available power supply allows for some limited draw for
future expansion modules called <em>helmets</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Affordable</strong>: μHAB will contain only the components necessary for a
successful mission as outlined below. Extra functionality will be
available in the form of completely separate additional <em>helmets</em> as
needed. By reducing the functionality to a minimum, μHAB lowers the
overall costs associated for a HAB launch and allows for more expansion.</p>
<h2 id="list-of-experiment-ideas">List of Experiment Ideas</h2>
<h3 id="stable-imaging-platform-bus-attitude-control">Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control</h3>
<p>Active gimbals make for a (power hungry) off-the-shelf solution for
image stabilization. For a challenge one could build a gimballed camera
mount from scratch.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>A more novel idea would be to control bus attitude. A senior design team
from 2017 attempted to do attitude control with a reaction wheel, but I
don't think they had a way to dump momentum. A simpler (and more novel)
approach would be to use RC aircraft engines or drone motors to actively
counteract wind forces. A simpler objective could be using drone
propellers for anti-spin control or active ballast weights for
anti-rocking control.</p>

balloon over a long-duration flight to gain detailed insights into the
conditions subjected to the hardware. Calibrate all sensors on the
ground in known conditions, ideally with an environmental test chamber,
prior to the flight.</p>
<p><strong>Experiments (Level I):</strong></p>
<ul>

  characterize the burst event in detail.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Experiments (Level III):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#altitude-control">Altitude Control</a>: Maintain flight at certain altitude(s)

</ul>
<h3 id="flying-robot">Flying Robot</h3>
<p><em>A knowledge-building mission that develops key building blocks toward
satellite-like operations tasks such as command and control, data links,

<ul>
<li><a href="#controlled-descent">Controlled Descent</a>: Automatically detect a free-fall

  change the speed and direction of descent. Descent should be controlled in a
  way that makes recovery of the payload easier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Experiments (Level III):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#altitude-control">Altitude Control</a>: Maintain a set altitude in flight and
  change the altitude set point in response to a command from the ground
  station.</li>
<li><a href="#stable-imaging-platform-bus-attitude-control">Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control</a>: 
  Maintain a set attitude (of the imaging platform) and change the target
  attitude in response to a command from the ground station.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rocket-technology-testbed">Rocket Technology Testbed</h3>
<p><em>A technology demonstration mission for key technologies meant for use with
rockets.</em></p>
<p>Develop avionics, logic, and other foundational technologies for controls,
telemetry, and ground stations using requirements based on what would be used
in an M-class hobby rocket. Select experiments that can be demonstrated on a
HAB and easily adapted for flight in a rocket.</p>

<li><a href="#stable-imaging-platform-bus-attitude-control">Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control</a>: 
  Use active control systems and actuators (reaction mass, ballast, control
  surfaces, or thrust) to stabilize the roll axis (the axis along the balloon
  tension line) during ascent and/or descent. In addition to control actuators,
  pointing knowledge is necessary to feed the control system. Special
  preference should be given to propulsive systems or aero control surfaces
  that could also be adapted for use during a rocket's ascent phase.</li>

                <h1 id="concept-selection">Concept Selection</h1>
<p>Concepts shown or adapted from this list may be included in the flight
design of TerraMICRO. Which concepts make it in depends on the combined
design effort required by their individual complexity, difficulty,
expected cost, team expertise in related fields, novelty, and interest
from the design team.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Since TerraMICRO is a demonstrator for a flight platform, there is no
limit to the complexity, cost, or difficulty of the experiments it
supports. A concept is considered feasible, then, if TerraHAB
contributors decide that it is sufficiently interesting, novel, or
within their pe1rsonal budgets for complexity, cost, and difficulty.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="concepts-vs-requirements">Concepts vs. Requirements</h2>
<p>Concepts are ideas. Ideas lead to objectives, and requirements are
derived to meet those objectives. It is important to remember that we
use concepts like those listed in this section in order to organize the
possible mission objectives and technology demonstrations, and later as
guiding principles for deciding actual mission objectives and
formulating design requirements from there.</p>
<h2 id="selection-criteria">Selection Criteria</h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Members of the TerraHAB team were polled on what aspects of a HAB project
motivate them and provide a fulfilling outlet for engineering skills.
Mission concepts should be crafted to meet these criteria because engineers
who take pride and genuine interest in a project do good work and stick with
it until the end.</p>
<p><strong>By building a high altitude balloon, I want to...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve my breadboarding and electrical engineering skills.</li>
<li>Learn how to design a PCB.</li>
<li>Finish a project, for once.</li>
<li>Set an example for RIT Space Exploration projects.</li>
<li>Work with my friends on an engineering project.</li>
<li>Learn how to program an FPGA for real time image processing.</li>
<li>Launch a HAB for the first time.</li>
<li>Develop a novel design for a difficult problem.</li>
<li>Publish elements of the design process and the results to the internet.</li>
<li>Build something that can be positively shown to recruiters and future
  employers.</li>
<li>keep my engineering skills sharp across many disciplines.</li>
<li>Improve my analog engineering skills.</li>
<li>Engineer cheap, COTS hardware to do the job that usually requires
  expensive or specialty hardware if you were to do it "in the real world."</li>
<li>Design a flexible platform that can be passed on to students.</li>
<li>Implement improved tracking capabilities.</li>
<li>Test subsystems until fully confident in launch capabilities.</li>
<li>Have a mission where <em>everything</em> succeeds.</li>
<li>Bring positive attention to RIT, RIT Space Exploration, and SPEXcast with
  media and blog posts.</li>
<li>Mutually feed on each other’s efforts &amp; passions to keep momentum.</li>
<li>Build the simplest concept that still satisfies my itch to do something
  novel and technical.</li>
<li>Learn and practice proper documentation skills.</li>
<li>Learn technologies I can’t use at work, without the overhead of it being
  safe.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="objective-criteria">Objective Criteria</h2>
<h3 id="complexity">Complexity</h3>
<p>Complex systems are more prone to design errors, have more failure modes, and
lead to overengineered solutions. Simple or elegent solutions are always
preferred over complicated ones, when possible. </p>
<p>Necessary complexity should be targeted and limited in scope. See also
<a href="#difficulty">Difficulty</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>This project is self funded out of our own pockets. Naturally, a lower cost is
better.</p>
<h3 id="potential-for-future-work">Potential for Future Work</h3>
<p>Engineering hours have the most "bang-for-buck" value on work that can be
reused in future projects, or at least contributes to technical skills of the
team (see also <a href="#personal-development">Personal Development</a>). Concepts that
have a clear path for future work or use in a future project are preferred.</p>
<h3 id="tiered-objectives">Tiered Objectives</h3>
<p>The ability for a concept to be broken down into smaller ones is an important
characteristic that can balance out <a href="#complexity">Complexity</a>. What we look for
is to get the most value out of every engineering hour spent working on this
project. So if a concept can be decomposed into smaller, independently useful
modules, those engineering hours don't go to waste. Even better if the modules
have <a href="#potential-for-future-work">Potential for Future Work</a>. Objectives would
be graduated by a combination of <a href="#complexity">Complexity</a> and
<a href="#difficulty">Difficulty</a>.</p>
<p>Ideally, a concept would be split into tiered objectives that also serve as
progression milestones. As long as the lowest tier objective is met, the HAB
will fly. Higher tier objectives are progressively more ambitious and advanced.</p>
<p>A tiered approach enables the best chance of success, so concepts that are
more easily broken up into tiered objectives are preferred.</p>
<div class="admonition note modular vs tiered objectives">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><strong>Example of a system that is modular but <em>not</em> tiered</strong>: <code>tlm module</code>,
<code>avionics module</code>, <code>sensing module</code>, <code>nuclear fusion module</code>. Here, if the
super complex module fails we don't really have a payload or experiment of
any sort.</p>
<p><strong>Example of a system that is modular <em>and</em> tiered</strong>: <code>tlm</code>, <code>sensing</code>,
<code>avionics</code>, <code>single axis spinning w/o controls</code> (maybe just gas + valves),
<code>single axis spin control</code> (add more complexity), <code>3 axis controls</code>,
<code>propulsive landing</code>. Where maybe that first leap into spinning is a
checkpoint, and if we do that we hit our minimum objective. Lets say we
hit the next one, <code>single axis control</code>, but when striving for 
<code>3-axis control</code> we stall. That's okay, because we'd launch with the last
checkpoint we achieved and still have a successful mission.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="subjective-criteria">Subjective Criteria</h2>
<h3 id="novelty">Novelty</h3>
<p>Novel concepts are interesting and unique, two aspects which are desirable.
It's the "cool factor."</p>
<p>Novelty is usually grouped with <a href="#complexity">Complexity</a>, but the two are
independent--novel concepts need not be complex.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h3>
<p>Difficulty is relative to one's prior training and expertise. The same problem
which may be simple to an experienced engineer could be very difficult to a
novice, especially if one is teaching themselves. <a href="#complexity">Complicated</a>
designs are usually more difficult.</p>
<p>Medium difficulty is preferred, as concepts are desired to be a challenge but
not so difficult as to be unreasonable to accomplish. See also 
<a href="#personal-development">Personal Development</a>.</p>
<h3 id="personal-development">Personal Development</h3>
<p>One of the goals of this project is to serve as a vector for personal learning
and development in technical skills, and professional development with a
technical project. It is preferred if some but not all of the concepts of a
design are in an area outside the team's expertise. This is coupled with
<a href="#difficulty">Difficulty</a>.</p>
<h1 id="concept-selection-matrix">Concept Selection Matrix</h1>
<p>A decision matrix is used to evaluate experiment mission concept feasibility in
a systematic way. By separating objective and subjective criteria, we can judge
concepts by their technological feasibility and interest to the team
independently.</p>
<h2 id="objective-selection-matrix">Objective Selection Matrix</h2>
<h2 id="objective-and-subjective-selection-matrix">Objective and Subjective Selection Matrix</h2>
<h2 id="selection-matrix-weighted-by-personal-preference">Selection Matrix Weighted by Personal Preference</h2>
<p>Each team member is given the opportunity to weight the selection criteria based
on personal preference. Normalizing the scores based on these weights may give
a better reflection of which concept would be best to pursue.</p>

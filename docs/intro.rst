Introduction
============

What is TerraHAB?
-----------------

TerraHAB is a group of engineers who are passionate about aerospace. The group
formed in November 2018 as an outlet for alumni members of the student-faculty
research group RIT Space Exploration (SPEX) to continue doing space-related
engineering projects.

TerraHAB's mission is to do novel things with accesible hardware, share the
knowledge gained along the way, and set an example of excellence for similar
hobby projects.

Why a High Altitude Balloon?
----------------------------

High Altitude Balloons (HABs) are low-cost, low-risk vehicles that are the
perfect platform for conducting small scale atmospheric studies, remote
sensing, and other experiments that make use of the "edge of space" conditions
found at altitudes in excess of 65,000 feet above sea level. Atmospheric
conditions in the stratosphere are fairly well understood insofar as the
humidity, temperatures, and pressures that must be weathered by a flight
platform. More specifically, ambient temperatures and pressures between
65,000--100,000, feet altitude see extremes of -60C and 0.05 atm respectively.

This opens the door for generic or payload-agnostic HAB platforms designed to
carry an experiment or instruments in conditions that approximate space. One
such platform is an avionics architecture called
`µHAB <https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/µHAB>`_, which is specifically
designed to be a robust and all-inclusive avionics package for HAB vehicles.
The `Technology Readiness Level <https://esto.nasa.gov/technologists_trl.html>`_
of µHAB is TRL 2 as of November 2018.

What is TerraMICRO?
-------------------

TerraMICRO is a high altitude balloon technology demonstration mission. The key
objectives of this mission are to validate the µHAB avionics architecture,
experiment with core technologies which enable long duration flights, and
collect high quality images from high altitudes. As a technology demonstrator,
TerraMICRO flight systems designed to be generic in order to support any future
missions. TerraHAB has selected long duration flights as a target for future
missions, and as such many of the systems beyond the core avionics are building
blocks toward this goal. At the time of launch, µHAB should be TRL 3, and upon
the successful completion of the TerraMICRO mission this architecture will be
TRL 5.

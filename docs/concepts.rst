Mission Concepts

TerraMICRO was conceived as a payload-agnostic high altitude balloon
architecture. In addition, TerraMICRO should host one or more technical or
scientific experiments. These experiments need not be related to uHAB---they
serve as a means to validate the design and architecture while stressing the
system in a real-world use case.

Concept Selection
=================

Concepts shown or adapted from this list may be included in the flight design
of TerraMICRO. Which concepts make it in depends on the combined design effort
required by their individual complexity, difficulty, expected cost, team
expertise in related fields, novelty, and interest from the design team.

.. note::
  Since TerraMICRO is a demonstrator for a flight platform, there is no limit
  to the complexity, cost, or difficulty of the experiments it supports. A
  concept is considered feasible, then, if TerraHAB contributors decide that it
  is sufficiently interesting, novel, or within their personal budgets for
  complexity, cost, and difficulty.

Concepts vs. Requirements
-------------------------

Ideas are not requirements, but requirements are derived from ideas.

Some requirements are non-negotiable, such as FCC and FAA regulations and
safety requirements.

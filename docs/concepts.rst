Mission Concepts
****************

TerraMICRO was conceived as a payload-agnostic high altitude balloon
architecture. In addition, TerraMICRO should host one or more technical or
scientific experiments. These experiments need not be related to uHAB---they
serve as a means to validate the design and architecture while stressing the
system in a real-world use case.

Concept Selection
=================

Concepts shown or adapted from this list may be included in the flight design
of TerraMICRO. Which concepts make it in depends on the combined design effort
required by their individual complexity, difficulty, expected cost, team
expertise in related fields, novelty, and interest from the design team.

.. note::
   Since TerraMICRO is a demonstrator for a flight platform, there is no limit
   to the complexity, cost, or difficulty of the experiments it supports. A
   concept is considered feasible, then, if TerraHAB contributors decide that
   it is sufficiently interesting, novel, or within their personal budgets for
   complexity, cost, and difficulty.

Concepts vs. Requirements
-------------------------

Concepts are ideas. Ideas lead to objectives, and requirements are derived to
meet those objectives. It is important to rememeber that we use concepts like
those listed in this section in order to organize the possible mission
objectives and technology demonstrations, and later as guiding principles for
deciding actual mission objectives and formulating design requirements from
there.

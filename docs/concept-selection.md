# Concept Selection

Concepts shown or adapted from this list may be included in the flight
design of TerraMICRO. Which concepts make it in depends on the combined
design effort required by their individual complexity, difficulty,
expected cost, team expertise in related fields, novelty, and interest
from the design team.

!!! note
    Since TerraMICRO is a demonstrator for a flight platform, there is no
    limit to the complexity, cost, or difficulty of the experiments it
    supports. A concept is considered feasible, then, if TerraHAB
    contributors decide that it is sufficiently interesting, novel, or
    within their pe1rsonal budgets for complexity, cost, and difficulty.

## Concepts vs. Requirements

Concepts are ideas. Ideas lead to objectives, and requirements are
derived to meet those objectives. It is important to remember that we
use concepts like those listed in this section in order to organize the
possible mission objectives and technology demonstrations, and later as
guiding principles for deciding actual mission objectives and
formulating design requirements from there.

## Selection Criteria

To be determined.

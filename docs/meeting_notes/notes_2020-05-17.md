### Mission Proposal
Strong capabilities that also unlocks future missions
* **MVP:** General sensing (Intra-balloon sensing, Atmospheric composition)
    * **Ideal:** Dynamics modeling 
<br />
* **MVP:** Altitude control (controls, novel)
    * **Ideal:** Attitude control / stabilization (Requires Dyamics modeling)
<br />
* **MVP:** Image processing (required for a lot of things)
    * **Ideal:** Pick one from first bullet below
<br />
* **MVP:** Real-time data transfer (This is required for basically everything)
    * **Ideal:** GND station visualization & processing
      * **Holy crap they actually did that:** Multiple base stations with telemetry repeater
<br />
* **MVP:** Ground station telemetry receiver (also required)
    * **Ideal:** Strongback deployment with tether
        * **Holy crap they actually did that:** Fill balloon through ground station

### General Project Discussion
- Some missions are required for other missions. One such example is image processing. 
    * Required for vegetation mapping, spectral imaging, star tracker, and image quality enhancement
  * Builds really well into others such as controlled descent
- Thoughts on a cross-country flight
    > Not ideal to start with this, but doable. It's probably best to build up from lower levels
- Seems that everyone is in agreement on wanting to do multiple missions
    > Building out technologies useful for future missions
- Much of this tech does not apply specifically to HABs, could be used for other missions as well (rockets, satellites)
- Refine tiered mission outline above into a full tiered mission description/proposal (MVP, Ideal, Holy crap they actually did that) [Defining Scope]
    * Come up with basic resource requirements for each
        * Time
        * Money
        * Tools/Resources
    * Optimizations for time or money (mission variants/tradeoffs)

### ENG-8 Discussion
[ENG-8 JIRA](https://terrahab.atlassian.net/browse/ENG-8)
* Thoughts on splitting up a system into mission-critical subsystems & defining verification standards for each
    * Austin: Sometimes hard to draw the line. What is mission critical?
    * Drew: Apply same 3 tiers (MVP, Ideal, Wow they actually did it) <br/>
        * Mission Critical Concern
            * Tracking / Recovery (complete loss otherwise)
            * Cutdown (Complete loss otherwise, safety)
            * Any pyro (Safety concerns)
        * Mission Success
            * Non-critical MVP subsystems
        * Mission Excellence
            * Everything works perfectly + novel science out of it
    * Daniel: Let's have a mindset that these define verification rigor for each specified tier
* Where is okay to take risks and develop without reviews or test?
* Process/Verification tier definitions
    * Mission Critical - review and validation essential, do not fly unless certain it will work
    * Mission Success - review required but some acceptable risk
    * Mission Excellence - dev/experimental, no review required. Sanity check is encouraged but not required
* Question about what documentation looks like
    * Decisions are justified within documentation posted online
    * Documentation is desired to be good, but nothing specific is currently required
    * Don't get bogged down, just get it done. Keep each other accountable
- [ ] TODO (Phil): Epic for this
    * Can discuss what process/verification is appropriate for each tier
    * May vary based on specific subsystem

### Cost & Funding

- Feel for budgets (Sugarhabby)
    * Phil - couple hundred bucks, more willing to put in additional time. Wants to travel to launch.
    * Matt - ~1,000 on just hardware with a goal of minimizing it. Wants to travel to launch.
    * Austin - couple hundred bucks, concern with unequal contribution & resulting dynamics
    * Drew - ~1,000 but would prefer to avoid specific purchases where necessary, not concerned about timeline but restricted weekly
    * Dan - Willing to buy my own hardware for my subsystems & equipment to enable remote access
- What can we leverage? 
    * Matt and Dan and Austin and Drew have 3D printers
    * Matt and Dan have soldering equipment, oscilloscopes, power supplies
    * Most everyone have microcontrollers
- Matt, Austin, Dan wants a complete set of hardware ideally
- Using COTS hardware (raspberry pi, microcontrollers - Arduino)
    * Austin: Concern about risk for timeline 
    * Dan: Doesn't want to use COTS micros or dev boards, doesn't map well to professional experience
- It's okay to have an intermediate step to launch with dev boards if we need to
- Desire to not reduce scope initially, want to aim for custom-embedded solutions initially
- What is the timeline? What slip is okay?
- Austin's 3 concerns
    * Risk of using in-house hardware
    * Designing for reusability can add a lot of complexity
    * More complexity with safety-critical components

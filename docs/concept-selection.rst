Concept Selection
*****************

Concepts shown or adapted from this list may be included in the flight design
of TerraMICRO. Which concepts make it in depends on the combined design effort
required by their individual complexity, difficulty, expected cost, team
expertise in related fields, novelty, and interest from the design team.

.. note::
   Since TerraMICRO is a demonstrator for a flight platform, there is no limit
   to the complexity, cost, or difficulty of the experiments it supports. A
   concept is considered feasible, then, if TerraHAB contributors decide that
   it is sufficiently interesting, novel, or within their personal budgets for
   complexity, cost, and difficulty.


.. _concept-vs-requirements:

Concepts vs. Requirements
=========================

Concepts are ideas. Ideas lead to objectives, and requirements are derived to
meet those objectives. It is important to remember that we use concepts like
those listed in this section in order to organize the possible mission
objectives and technology demonstrations, and later as guiding principles for
deciding actual mission objectives and formulating design requirements from
there.


.. _concept-selection-criteria:

Selection Criteria
==================

.. note::

   Members of the TerraHAB team were polled on what aspects of a HAB project
   motivate them and provide a fulfilling outlet for engineering skills.
   Mission concepts should be crafted to meet these criteria because engineers
   who take pride and genuine interest in a project do good work and stick with
   it until the end.

   **By building a high altitude balloon, I want to...**

   - Improve my breadboarding and electrical engineering skills.
   - Learn how to design a PCB.
   - Finish a project, for once.
   - Set an example for RIT Space Exploration projects.
   - Work with my friends on an engineering project.
   - Learn how to program an FPGA for real time image processing.
   - Launch a HAB for the first time.
   - Develop a novel design for a difficult problem.
   - Publish elements of the design process and the results to the internet.
   - Build something that can be positively shown to recruiters and future
     employers.
   - keep my engineering skills sharp across many disciplines.
   - Improve my analog engineering skills.
   - Engineer cheap, COTS hardware to do the job that usually requires
     expensive or specialty hardware if you were to do it "in the real world."
   - Design a flexible platform that can be passed on to students.
   - Implement improved tracking capabilities.
   - Test subsystems until fully confident in launch capabilities.
   - Have a mission where *everything* succeeds.
   - Bring positive attention to RIT, RIT Space Exploration, and SPEXcast with
     media and blog posts.
   - Mutually feed on each other’s efforts & passions to keep momentum.
   - Build the simplest concept that still satisfies my itch to do something
     novel and technical.
   - Learn and practice proper documentation skills.
   - Learn technologies I can’t use at work, without the overhead of it being
     safe.

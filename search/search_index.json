TerraHAB is a group of engineers who are passionate about aerospace. The group formed in November 2018 as an outlet for alumni members of the student-faculty research group RIT Space Exploration (SPEX) to continue doing space-related engineering projects. TerraHAB's mission is to do novel things with accesible hardware, share the knowledge gained along the way, and set an example of excellence for similar hobby projects. Why a High Altitude Balloon? High Altitude Balloons (HABs) are low-cost, low-risk vehicles that are the perfect platform for conducting small scale atmospheric studies, remote sensing, and other experiments that make use of the \"edge of space\" conditions found at altitudes in excess of 65,000 feet above sea level. Atmospheric conditions in the stratosphere are fairly well understood insofar as the humidity, temperatures, and pressures that must be weathered by a flight platform. More specifically, ambient temperatures and pressures between 65,000--100,000, feet altitude see extremes of -60C and 0.05 atm respectively. This opens the door for generic or payload-agnostic HAB platforms designed to carry an experiment or instruments in conditions that approximate space. One such platform is an avionics architecture called \u00b5HAB , which is specifically designed to be a robust and all-inclusive avionics package for HAB vehicles. The Technology Readiness Level of \u00b5HAB is TRL 2 as of November 2018. What is TerraMICRO? TerraMICRO is a high altitude balloon technology demonstration mission. The key objectives of this mission are to validate the \u00b5HAB avionics architecture, experiment with core technologies which enable long duration flights, and collect high quality images from high altitudes. As a technology demonstrator, TerraMICRO flight systems designed to be generic in order to support any future missions. TerraHAB has selected long duration flights as a target for future missions, and as such many of the systems beyond the core avionics are building blocks toward this goal. At the time of launch, \u00b5HAB should be TRL 3, and upon the successful completion of the TerraMICRO mission this architecture will be TRL 5.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#terramicro","text":"This is the documentation homepage for TerraMICRO, Mission 1 of the TerraHAB Project.

Which concepts make it in depends on the combined design effort required by their individual complexity, difficulty, expected cost, team expertise in related fields, novelty, and interest from the design team. Note Since TerraMICRO is a demonstrator for a flight platform, there is no limit to the complexity, cost, or difficulty of the experiments it supports. A concept is considered feasible, then, if TerraHAB contributors decide that it is sufficiently interesting, novel, or within their pe1rsonal budgets for complexity, cost, and difficulty. Concepts vs. Requirements Concepts are ideas. Ideas lead to objectives, and requirements are derived to meet those objectives. It is important to remember that we use concepts like those listed in this section in order to organize the possible mission objectives and technology demonstrations, and later as guiding principles for deciding actual mission objectives and formulating design requirements from there. Selection Criteria Note Members of the TerraHAB team were polled on what aspects of a HAB project motivate them and provide a fulfilling outlet for engineering skills. Mission concepts should be crafted to meet these criteria because engineers who take pride and genuine interest in a project do good work and stick with it until the end. By building a high altitude balloon, I want to... Improve my breadboarding and electrical engineering skills. Learn how to design a PCB. Finish a project, for once. Set an example for RIT Space Exploration projects. Work with my friends on an engineering project. Learn how to program an FPGA for real time image processing. Launch a HAB for the first time. Develop a novel design for a difficult problem. Publish elements of the design process and the results to the internet. Build something that can be positively shown to recruiters and future employers. keep my engineering skills sharp across many disciplines. Improve my analog engineering skills. Engineer cheap, COTS hardware to do the job that usually requires expensive or specialty hardware if you were to do it \"in the real world.\" Design a flexible platform that can be passed on to students. Implement improved tracking capabilities. Test subsystems until fully confident in launch capabilities. Have a mission where everything succeeds. Bring positive attention to RIT, RIT Space Exploration, and SPEXcast with media and blog posts. Mutually feed on each other\u2019s efforts & passions to keep momentum. Build the simplest concept that still satisfies my itch to do something novel and technical. Learn and practice proper documentation skills. Learn technologies I can\u2019t use at work, without the overhead of it being safe. Objective Criteria Complexity Complex systems are more prone to design errors, have more failure modes, and lead to overengineered solutions. Simple or elegent solutions are always preferred over complicated ones, when possible. Necessary complexity should be targeted and limited in scope. See also Difficulty . Cost This project is self funded out of our own pockets. Naturally, a lower cost is better. Potential for Future Work Engineering hours have the most \"bang-for-buck\" value on work that can be reused in future projects, or at least contributes to technical skills of the team (see also Personal Development ). Concepts that have a clear path for future work or use in a future project are preferred. Tiered Objectives The ability for a concept to be broken down into smaller ones is an important characteristic that can balance out Complexity . What we look for is to get the most value out of every engineering hour spent working on this project. So if a concept can be decomposed into smaller, independently useful modules, those engineering hours don't go to waste. Even better if the modules have Potential for Future Work . Objectives would be graduated by a combination of Complexity and Difficulty . Ideally, a concept would be split into tiered objectives that also serve as progression milestones. As long as the lowest tier objective is met, the HAB will fly. Higher tier objectives are progressively more ambitious and advanced. A tiered approach enables the best chance of success, so concepts that are more easily broken up into tiered objectives are preferred. Note Example of a system that is modular but not tiered : tlm module , avionics module , sensing module , nuclear fusion module . Here, if the super complex module fails we don't really have a payload or experiment of any sort. Example of a system that is modular and tiered : tlm , sensing , avionics , single axis spinning w/o controls (maybe just gas + valves), single axis spin control (add more complexity), 3 axis controls , propulsive landing . Where maybe that first leap into spinning is a checkpoint, and if we do that we hit our minimum objective. Lets say we hit the next one, single axis control , but when striving for 3-axis control we stall. That's okay, because we'd launch with the last checkpoint we achieved and still have a successful mission. Subjective Criteria Novelty Novel concepts are interesting and unique, two aspects which are desirable. It's the \"cool factor.\" Novelty is usually grouped with Complexity , but the two are independent--novel concepts need not be complex. Difficulty Difficulty is relative to one's prior training and expertise. The same problem which may be simple to an experienced engineer could be very difficult to a novice, especially if one is teaching themselves. Complicated designs are usually more difficult. Medium difficulty is preferred, as concepts are desired to be a challenge but not so difficult as to be unreasonable to accomplish. See also Personal Development . Personal Development One of the goals of this project is to serve as a vector for personal learning and development in technical skills, and professional development with a technical project. It is preferred if some but not all of the concepts of a design are in an area outside the team's expertise. This is coupled with Difficulty . Concept Selection Matrix A decision matrix is used to evaluate experiment mission concept feasibility in a systematic way. By separating objective and subjective criteria, we can judge concepts by their technological feasibility and interest to the team independently. Objective Selection Matrix Objective and Subjective Selection Matrix Selection Matrix Weighted by Personal Preference Each team member is given the opportunity to weight the selection criteria based on personal preference. Normalizing the scores based on these weights may give a better reflection of which concept would be best to pursue.","title":"Concept Selection"},{"location":"concept-selection/#concept-selection","text":"Concepts shown or adapted from this list may be included in the flight design of TerraMICRO.

In addition, TerraMICRO should host one or more technical or scientific experiments. These experiments need not be related to uHAB---they serve as a means to validate the design and architecture while stressing the system in a real-world use case. \u03bcHAB Architecture Note \u03bcHAB is under active development. Visit the project's GitHub page for \u00b5HAB designs and documentation . The purpose of \u03bcHAB is to provide a flexible, expandable, and affordable platform that contains all of the necessary functionality for a high-altitude balloon mission without the hassle of starting a completely new design from scratch. Flexible : \u03bcHAB contains a wealth of available I/O that is broken out to easily accessible headers. Both 5V and 3.3V digital pins are available for ease of future component integrations. The powerful 300MHz, 32-bit microcontroller has capabilities for CANbus, EBI/EMI, Ethernet, I\u00b2C, IrDA, LINbus, MMC/SD/SDIO, QSPI, SPI, SSC, UART/USART, USB, x24 16-bit ADC (with oversampling), and x2 12-bit DAC. \u03bcHAB also features selection headers for multiple types of antennas and remove-before-flight safes. Expandable : The layout of the PCB includes the familiar pinout of the common Arduino Mega so that commercial Arduino shields may be utilized. Additional I/O is available separately. The microcontroller selected offers enough processing power to handle many more additional tasks and the available power supply allows for some limited draw for future expansion modules called helmets . Affordable : \u03bcHAB will contain only the components necessary for a successful mission as outlined below. Extra functionality will be available in the form of completely separate additional helmets as needed. By reducing the functionality to a minimum, \u03bcHAB lowers the overall costs associated for a HAB launch and allows for more expansion. List of Experiment Ideas Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control Active gimbals make for a (power hungry) off-the-shelf solution for image stabilization. For a challenge one could build a gimballed camera mount from scratch. 1 A more novel idea would be to control bus attitude. A senior design team from 2017 attempted to do attitude control with a reaction wheel, but I don't think they had a way to dump momentum. A simpler (and more novel) approach would be to use RC aircraft engines or drone motors to actively counteract wind forces. A simpler objective could be using drone propellers for anti-spin control or active ballast weights for anti-rocking control. Pairs with: On-board Image Processing , Rocket Technology Testbed Altitude Control Actively change the ascent or descent rate. For a simpler demonstration, only control the ascent rate. For a challenge, maintain an altitude set point. For a greater challenge, extend the flight duration by controlling altitude. 2 Pairs with: Intra-balloon Environment Sensors Intra-balloon Environment Sensors Develop a sensor platform to measure environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity) within the balloon from ambient, through filling, and finally through the burst event. Send the data to the main payload storage over a wired or wireless link. As a stretch goal, instrument the bus with environmental sensors. Compare balloon internal conditions to ambient ones add correlate it with altitude rate of change or burst events. Pairs with: Altitude Control , Characterize Atmospheric Composition , Model and Test Latex Balloon Burst Conditions On-board Image Processing Perform image processing (of any level) on images or video on the payload electronics in flight. 3 For an extra challenge, apply any of the following constraints: Payload electronics do not exceed $30. Image processing algorithms have a practical or scientific usebeyond a simple demonstrator. Image processing takes place on an FPGA. Bonus if it occurs in realtime. Image processing includes data fusion with additional sensors orcamera sources. Pairs with: Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control Real-time Data Transfer Receive real time telemetry and payload data in flight. For a greater challenge, send commands from a ground station during the flight. For a simple demonstration, send limited health and status telemetry. As a stretch, send rich data (like photos or live video) to a ground station in flight. Pairs with: Intra-balloon Environment Sensors , Characterize Atmospheric Composition , Characterize Radiation Environment , Altitude Control , Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control , Rocket Technology Testbed Characterize Atmospheric Composition Measure atmospheric composition along the balloon's ascent. Characterize how composition changes with altitude. For a greater challenge, use multiple flights to see how composition changes with altitude from different geographic locations, time of day, time of year, or different weather conditions. Pairs with: Altitude Control , Intra-balloon Environment Sensors Characterize Radiation Environment Measure radiation intensity along the balloon's ascent. Characterize how intensity changes with altitude. For a greater challenge, use multiple flights to see how intensity changes with altitude from different geographic locations, time of day, time of year, or different weather conditions. Pairs with: Altitude Control , Intra-balloon Environment Sensors Model and Test Latex Balloon Burst Conditions Prior to launch, predict the conditions that lead to the balloon's burst event. Instrument the payload and balloon to test the model in flight. For an extra challenge, apply any of the following constraints: Model the burst event only using parameters that can be measured in flight. Test the model on the ground with simulated atmospheric conditions and a sub- or full-scale balloon. Record high-speed video of the balloon bursting in flight. Pairs with: Intra-balloon Environment Sensors Controlled Descent After balloon cutdown, control the descent of the payload. For a simpler challenge, use a reefed parachute. For a greater challenge, steer the descent path using a parafoil or aero control surfaces. Pairs with: Rocket Technology Testbed , Advanced Dynamics Modelling Vegetation Density Experiment Measure vegetation density using NDVI with cameras in flight. For a greater challenge, do the image processing on-board. 4 Pairs with: Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control , On-board Image Processing F' Flight Software Ecosystem F' (F Prime) is a component-driven framework that enables rapid development and deployment of spaceflight and other embedded software applications. 5 F' is part of NASA Jet Propultion Lab's technology ecosystem, open source, and also has demos that are meant to be run on a Raspberry Pi. F' can be used to create common HAB flight software leveraging existing components. The team will create additional components to meet the needs of specific HABs, with the ability to open source for use by other HAB teams. Run HAB FSW with F' using a one off greedy customization, not going out of the way for code reuse. Design HAB FSW with F' to be common and for use by other HAB teams as a base. Design hardware payloads with accompanying F' components to be common for use by teams that want a plug and play HAB payload. Pairs with: Long Distance Communications Send or receive data to the HAB in flight while it is beyond visual range. For a greater challenge, send or receive data while the HAB is beyond the geographical horizon of the ground station. Pairs with: Real-time Data Transfer Multispectral / Hyperspectral Instrument Image the Earth, sky, or atmospheric limb with a camera sensitive to two or more spectral bands. Optionally apply any of the following constraints: Use components which cost no more than $50. 6 Calibrate the instrument on the ground (optionally in flight-like conditions) Pairs with: Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control , On-board Image Processing , Vegetation Density Experiment Star Tracker Build an instrument that measures position of the payload bus based on optical measurements of the sky. 7 8 Optionally apply any of the following constraints: Use components which cost no more than $50. Calibrate the instrument on the ground (optionally in flight-like conditions) Implement a custom algorithm to derive orientation from images of the sky. Pairs with: Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control , On-board Image Processing Synthetic Image Quality Enhancement Use computer vision techniques to improve the effective resolution of images by either of the following methods: Stitch multiple image frames into a larger composite image of an area wider than the camera's field of view. 9 Use multi-frame super-resolution algorithms to create high resolution image products from low resolution images captured in flight. 10 11 Pairs with : Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control , On-board Image Processing Advanced Dynamics Modelling Create a dynamics model for the HAB bus that accounts for differential drag bus geometry, variable wind speed and direction, variable ambient pressure, twist and tension from the balloon tether, and the center of gravity of the bus or mass and location of internal components. If attitude control is also under consideration, also model the effects of that control system and simulate its behavior in different situations. Pairs with: Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control , Altitude Control , Controlled Descent , Flight Conditions Characterizer , Mission Monitoring Ground Station Monitor telemetry in flight or during tests and display telemetry and other information with an intuitive user interface. For a greater challenge, also implement command and control elements. Examples of UI elements that could be used are: Live-updating plots of telemetry values over time Live-updating log messages from the avionics Live video feeds from cameras on board Command and control interfaces for sending messages to the vehicle Pairs with: Real-time Data Transfer Mothership for Smaller Vehicles Stow smaller vehicles such as tiny quadcopters on the HAB and release them in flight. For a greater challenge, use the HAB as a relay for recording data or sending data from the child vehicles back to Mission Control. Pairs with: Real-time Data Transfer , Long Distance Communications Sprawled Small Scale HABs Design and build a small scale HAB (50 grams) which includes a downward facing camera. The small scale HABs should be able to function for at least a few hours, this includes power on time and storage requirements. Multiple of these small scale HABs will be connected together with lightweight wire or string. The collective HABs can be used to map out the terrain over large distances as connections between individual HABs will be lengthy (maybe 500m - 1km). Pairs with: Vegetation Density Experiment Launch Platform Develop a launch platform system capable of controlling the payload during launch preparations. Includes clamp system to retain payload to the ground during launch preparation. Data/Power/Fueling connections available to interface with the payload. System would allow for hands off approach during setup from filling the balloon to last minute software updates and real time telemetry without relying on onboard radios. Design can be tiered, for example power and data would be primary goal and fueling cabilities as a stretch goal. Pairs with: Mission Monitoring Ground Station Balloon Movement Sensors Develop a sensor platform to measure inertial movement of balloon (acceleration, rotation, magnetic heading) through full flight of balloon. Send the data to the main payload storage over a wired or wireless link. Correlate data with similar sensors on the HAB bus to create better stabilization algorithms and control methods. Pairs with: Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control , On-board Image Processing , Intra-balloon Environment Sensors Reference Missions This section outlines reference payloads and mission profiles for TerraMICRO which satisfy the main mission objective of demonstrating the uHAB avionics architecture by supporting a combination of technical or scientific experiments. Vegetation Density Mapper The spiritual successor to Where U At Plants? and Phil's vision for HAB CV . Mount at least two ground-facing cameras to the HAB payload. Collect photos or videos of the ground in the Red and Near-Infrared spectral bands as needed to compute NDVI on the ground below. Calibrate spectral response and lens distortion of all payload cameras on the ground before flight. Experiments (Level I): Vegetation Density Experiment : Record flight data (GPS coordinates, altitude, orientation) in sync with image captures. Use flight data, camera field of view, and image data to project image data onto a map. Flight data and imagery is stored to local memory. All data processing and analysis takes place after flight data is recovered. Experiments (Level II): On-board Image Processing : Perform data processing (linking flight data to imagery) and analysis (compute NDVI) on-board during the flight. Real-time Data Transfer : Downlink all or part of the data to a ground station while in flight. Experiments (Level III): Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control : Use active control systems and actuators (reaction mass, ballast, electric motors, thrust) to stabilize the platform where the payload cameras are mounted. In addition to control actuators, pointing knowledge is necessary to feed the control system. Flight Conditions Characterizer A knowledge-gathering mission to inform flight characteristics and environments on future HAB flights. Instrument the HAB bus to measure ambient conditions, internal conditions within the bus structure, and internal conditions within the balloon over a long-duration flight to gain detailed insights into the conditions subjected to the hardware. Calibrate all sensors on the ground in known conditions, ideally with an environmental test chamber, prior to the flight. Experiments (Level I): Characterize Atmospheric Composition : Measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and composition of the air over the course of the flight. Characterize Radiation Environment : Measure ionizing radiation flux (using a geiger counter) over the course of the flight. Advanced Dynamics Modelling : Model the dynamics of the flight and validate the model with flight data. Experiments (Level II): Intra-balloon Environment Sensors : Measure temperature, humidity, pressure and density of helium within the balloon. Also measure detailed thermal gradients throughout the payload bus and components. Real-time Data Transfer : Downlink all or part of the data to a ground station while in flight. Model and Test Latex Balloon Burst Conditions : Model and test (on the ground) the conditions that lead to the balloon's burst event. Instrument the balloon and payload to validate this model and characterize the burst event in detail. Experiments (Level III): Altitude Control : Maintain flight at certain altitude(s) to gain more data about the conditions at that height in order to smooth out outliers and variations. Optionally extend mission flight time to gain more data. Flying Robot A knowledge-building mission that develops key building blocks toward satellite-like operations tasks such as command and control, data links, and ACS systems (like detumbling). Send commands from a ground station that are executed by the HAB in flight. The HAB reacts to both command instructions and stimuli from its environment. Experiments (Level I): Real-time Data Transfer : Downlink all or part of the data to a ground station while in flight. Execute commands sent from a ground station and report acknowledgement of a received command to the ground. Experiments (Level II): Controlled Descent : Automatically detect a free-fall state and use active controls and actuators (parafoil, control surfaces) to change the speed and direction of descent. Descent should be controlled in a way that makes recovery of the payload easier. Experiments (Level III): Altitude Control : Maintain a set altitude in flight and change the altitude set point in response to a command from the ground station. Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control : Maintain a set attitude (of the imaging platform) and change the target attitude in response to a command from the ground station. Rocket Technology Testbed A technology demonstration mission for key technologies meant for use with rockets. Develop avionics, logic, and other foundational technologies for controls, telemetry, and ground stations using requirements based on what would be used in an M-class hobby rocket. Select experiments that can be demonstrated on a HAB and easily adapted for flight in a rocket.

Experiments (Level III): Stable Imaging Platform / Bus Attitude Control : Use active control systems and actuators (reaction mass, ballast, control surfaces, or thrust) to stabilize the roll axis (the axis along the balloon tension line) during ascent and/or descent. In addition to control actuators, pointing knowledge is necessary to feed the control system. Special preference should be given to propulsive systems or aero control surfaces that could also be adapted for use during a rocket's ascent phase. Haumpton, Shane. 2018.

Visit the project's GitHub page for \u00b5HAB designs and documentation . The purpose of \u03bcHAB is to provide a flexible, expandable, and affordable platform that contains all of the necessary functionality for a high-altitude balloon mission without the hassle of starting a completely new design from scratch. Flexible : \u03bcHAB contains a wealth of available I/O that is broken out to easily accessible headers. Both 5V and 3.3V digital pins are available for ease of future component integrations. The powerful 300MHz, 32-bit microcontroller has capabilities for CANbus, EBI/EMI, Ethernet, I\u00b2C, IrDA, LINbus, MMC/SD/SDIO, QSPI, SPI, SSC, UART/USART, USB, x24 16-bit ADC (with oversampling), and x2 12-bit DAC. \u03bcHAB also features selection headers for multiple types of antennas and remove-before-flight safes. Expandable : The layout of the PCB includes the familiar pinout of the common Arduino Mega so that commercial Arduino shields may be utilized. Additional I/O is available separately. The microcontroller selected offers enough processing power to handle many more additional tasks and the available power supply allows for some limited draw for future expansion modules called helmets . Affordable : \u03bcHAB will contain only the components necessary for a successful mission as outlined below. Extra functionality will be available in the form of completely separate additional helmets as needed. By reducing the functionality to a minimum, \u03bcHAB lowers the overall costs associated for a HAB launch and allows for more expansion.","title":"\u03bcHAB Architecture"},{"location":"concepts/#list-of-experiment-ideas","text":"","title":"List of Experiment Ideas"},{"location":"concepts/#stable-imaging-platform-bus-attitude-control","text":"Active gimbals make for a (power hungry) off-the-shelf solution for image stabilization.

Survey results https://forms.gle/jEudqDD1d41CS5Lr7 People All responses show interest. Matt, Dan, Phil, Austin B, Drew W. Dylan W and James P also expressed interest but have not responded to the survey. HAB vs Rocket vs Other 4 HAB, 3 Rocket, no other. 5 responses, so one person did not vote for any? - Dan put just rockets, Phil and Matt put both so that's 3 for rockets - The rest of the responses did just HAB. Time commitment Median: 4 hrs/week Mean: 3.5 hrs/week It's good that the median and mean are close together, and close to what we expected. Personal goals The list of goals we got months ago is still accurate. Bottom line: - Do cool stuff - Do stuff that you can't do at work - Do stuff well Selection criteria Takeaways: - Complexity is targeted and limited - Novelty/uniqueness and interestingness is important - It is important to be able to have a reasonable chance of finishing Experiment ideas satellite communications (starlink high bandwidth, Iridium packets, etc) grid fin stabilization Video encoding with a raw sensor input Live video and data streaming SDR-based radar altimeter Super sick ground station with a beautiful UI and solid telemetry depth rust mcu avionics JIRA https://terrahab.atlassian.net/ Right now - Engineering - which is everything thats not PM or DOC - Documentation - can be in parallel to engineering, includes site docs and schematics etc - Project Mgmt - sys eng and admin related things like setting up tools Add new ticket types/projects as needed -> EE or MECH etc It looks like a lot but its not! Don't sweat it. Change documentation to be a ticket type in every project Rockets If we want to do a rocket eventually, why not start now? Well, would we want to build the whole rocket or just a payload? Where is the real interest at? Phil: Making the rocket do something, not manufacturing/assembly Actuators, command and control, telemetry and sensors, controls HAB vs Rocket is a flea market vs rock concert HABs are the safer option. Better chances of success. Dan: Avionics. Rockets have much more interesting/challenging environment. Doing a custom rocket (rather than a kit) is the interesting bit. Doing rocket tech, especially propulsion and controls, sets us up better for future projects. Matt: Building a rocket would be cool but being a distributed team makes that a little less feasible (can't drive to LA every weekend). The interest comes from just more excited about rockets than HABs. Launch site (FAR) is nearby, there are groups interested in the assembly and construction. Maybe we could work together with them... Tier 1 project would be a fully fledged avionics platform. Telemetry, command and control, etc. Could be shared with HAB tech This is bare bones requirement for a rocket to fly Phil: The satisfaction of rockets is in the launch Dan & Matt: the things worked on (at least in avionics) are applicable to both What mission experiments could we do that translate between HAB and rocket? Thrust vectoring is interesting. Could we have cold gas RCS on the HAB? Roll stabilization would be the same for a HAB and a rocket On descent, stabilization would also be the same for both Other thrust vectoring and stabilization is good for propulsive landing Only Phil, Dan, and Matt expressed wanting to do a rocket, but so far we're the only ones super interested in doing work so far. Future meetings Sundays at noon for now. ACTIONS Phil to add descriptions to the selection criteria we already thought of based on responses from the survey Phil to add new experiment ideas to the list Phil to change documentation to be a ticket type in every jira project and remove the DOC project Phil to update the mission concepts page \"Controlled Descent\" entry with ideas about roll stabilization and other rocket crossovers.
